# Northwind-Analytics
End to end BI solution featuring interactive tableau dashboards. This repository consists of:
- The python script used to load the well known Northwind database into Tableau Publc Desktop.
- The SQL queries used to create the tables for RFM analysis, KPI indicators and inventory risk metrics.
- Documentation about the process of my analysis.

I welcome all constructive criticism in regard to my analysis, code and documentation. If you have insight(s) to share, email me at the email on my profile.
